               be used. I’m not seeking a title but a position where I can remain hands on and yet be given
               enough responsibility and trust to really contribute to the company. In my career I’ve had
               the  privilege to built really great development teams, and with them create powerful
               and successful frameworks and applications. I’m hoping these experiences and my strong
               technical and creative abilities will be exploited. Although I’ve often led teams I’m also
               very willing to take a back seat; listen, learn, reflect and then contribute.""",
               
    "bio": """I’m currently head of R&D and Shared Technical Services for RBC CM. I wasn’t always in finance and tried my best to avoid this domain. I started work in 1979 for the Electric Coin company programming slot machines, developed games for Atari, functional programming languages for Imperial College, fuzzy logic control systems for Unilever, and Occam based neural networks on Transputers.
